      <body>
        <p>You are in “The Walking Dead” there is a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies, colloquially referred to as "walkers", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them; they are attracted to noise, such as gunshots, and to different scents, e.g. humans. It is proven that only humans that are bitten or scratched by walkers can turn into other walkers, but ALSO living humans carry the pathogen responsible for the mutation. The mutation is activated after the death of the pathogen's host, and the only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or destroy the body, such as by cremating it.You wake up from a coma to discover this apocalypse. You are all alone and your main goal is to find you family and do your best to survive.CAN YOU SURVIVE?!</p>

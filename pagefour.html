<p>YOU are part of a Umbrella Security Service (USS) Delta team that enters the Raccoon City Underground Laboratory, where they meet up with Alpha team leader HUNK. Your teamâ€™s mission is to assist Alpha team in stopping Dr. William Birkin from handing over his T-virus research to the U.S. military and retrieve the G-virus. On your way to Birkin's lab, you find that Birkin has paid numerous Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (UBCS) mercenaries to work for him while the deal goes forward. When they reach Birkin's lab, the doctor is shot, and HUNK and another Alpha leave with the samples. They soon find that Birkin survived the attack and infected himself with the virus. The Birkin creature proceeds to kill off most of Alpha team before disappearing; HUNK offers to go back in search of the sample.
Not long after the battle, it becomes evident that the T-virus has leaked citywide, and people are beginning to transform into flesh-hungry zombies. In what they see as a punishment by USS command, your team is ordered to remove evidence of Umbrella's role in the outbreak. Heading into Raccoon City Hall, your team meets with a UBCS mercenary and their monitor Nicholai Ginovaef; he is soon revealed as a traitor and attempts to kill your team.
Later, your team is sent out around Raccoon Park to find the Nemesis-T Type, which has gone rogue. A second parasite is injected into its body in order to bring it back under control. Shortly after this mission is completed, your team is then sent out to the Raccoon City Police Department, ordered to kill any surviving police officers and destroy evidence linking the company to the outbreak. When this is done, you exit the station, and soon after encounter Leon S. Kennedy a rookie cop, whom they begin to hunt down along with Sherry Birkin(Dr. William Birkins Daughter) who is the key of ending the outbreak. After they find and corner Leon, his partner Claire Redfield and Sherry, you have two decisions: you and the surviving members of your team resign from Umbrella over their abandonment during the mission and betray them by letting the three live OR you can execute Leon and Claire and have Sherry sent to an Umbrella facility.
CAN YOU SURVIVE?!</p>

</head>ALCATRAZ Prison AKA MOB OF THE DEAD
      <body>
        <p>The story starts somewhere around the 1930's. The main character, named Salvatore DeLuca, has built himself an empire of drug/alcohol distribution, prostitution and gambling. When the police finally get the hang of this mobster; he was locked away in Alcatraz Prison along with 3 of his closest "business partners". They were named Billy Handsome, Michael O'Leary (nickname is "Finn") and Albert Arlington (nickname is "The Weasel"). They were sentenced to be locked away until they die because of these heavy accusations. (CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER)
Since our dear friend Arlington couldn't stand to be locked away forever, he managed to create an escape plan with a plane he invented himself (which was later called the "Icarus" in-game). The three others weren't really into his plan but after a short while The Weasel managed to get the three as his back-up. As you will realize, jail can and will be very frustrating for anyone in it and it didn't take long before Finn, Salvatore and Billy became quite pissed about the way The Weasel. After a lot of complications, the plan was abandoned and the plane was never built; and this very reason frustrated the three mobsters.
Because they couldn't handle defeat, the three began to construct their own weapons. They lured The Weasel on the roof of the prison, where they attacked him and left him for dead. This happened on the night of December 31st, 1933. That was the reason these three were sentenced to death by the electric chair. This was executed on the morning of January 19th, 1934.
While flying between living and the actual afterlife; the group of four is sent back in time on December 31st, 1933 to Alcatraz Prison, where zombies have taken over the prison. There is also a lone guard wandering about and he goes by the name of Brutus.
Because DeLuca, Finn and O'Leary don't have any memory of the murder they had done, or the frustration they had when Arlington's escape plan was abandoned; they decided to work together as a team to get out of prison.
This is where the Easter Egg really comes in.
The first step of the Easter Egg requires you to find the key to Wardens Office. Why you ask? Well, for one: you need it to get all the plane parts. You need the key to open the gate near the laundry machine and you will need it in the Wardens Office itself after you overpowered the generators in a building close to the docks. You will also need it to open a gate on the docks itself and you will need it to open the gate with the number on the panels. Once you have the correct numbers on the displays, the plane piece will be a floor below where it was. The last part is in a small cabin near the third hellhound and close to the roof.
The 4 companions try to escape the prison by using the plane, but they fail miserably by crashing into the Golden Gate Bridge. They tried this multiple times to escape Alcatraz (as you might not already know because of the Easter Egg, they tried it 3 times) and when they spawned in Alcatraz Prison for the third time (after killing themselves three times) on the electric chairs, see the connection?); they came to mind that they are in fact already dead. It's time to figure something else out, no?
One step of the Easter Egg is putting in number on the panel you used before to get access to a part of the plane. These numbers are actually the numbers each of these mobster had on them while they were in prison. After completing this step, Stanley Ferguson will start to narrate how it was in the past and that's how the three murderers remember that they never escaped and that they killed The Weasel because of that reason.
Then you fly to the golden gate bridge but in purgatory mode which when you land you will see your body sitting on the electric chair (creepy and confusing I know lol)
After that step you have two options. When you decide to kill The Weasel; you will get the message that the cycle continues; thus meaning that the players will spawn back in on Alcatraz Prison with no memory of what happened on the night of December 31st, 1933. If you guys decide that Weasel will be the one surviving; it means that the cycle is broken and what that exactly means is currently unknown today.
CAN YOU SURVIVE?!</p>
